**About: **

Anomaly detection in credit card transactions refers to the process of identifying unusual or fraudulent activities in credit card transactions. It involves applying statistical, machine learning and Power BI techniques to detect patterns and deviations from normal behaviour, helping to identify potential fraudulent transactions in real-time. 

**Project Overview: **

The objective of this project is to develop a Power BI dashboard for anomaly detection in credit card transactions. Anomaly detection is crucial for detecting fraudulent activities and ensuring the security of credit card transactions. By leveraging Power BI's data visualisation and analytical capabilities, we can create an interactive dashboard that provides insights into transaction patterns and identifies potential anomalies. 

**Project Steps: **

**● Dataset Info:** 


➢ step - maps a unit of time in the real world. In this case 1 step is 1 hour of time. Total steps 744 (30 days simulation). 


➢ type - CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER. 

➢ amount - amount of the transaction in local currency. 

➢ nameOrig - customer who started the transaction 

➢ oldbalanceOrg - initial balance before the transaction 

➢ newbalanceOrig - new balance after the transaction 

➢ nameDest - customer who is the recipient of the transaction 

➢ oldbalanceDest - initial balance recipient before the transaction. Note that there is no information for customers that start with M (Merchants). 

➢ newbalanceDest - new balance recipient after the transaction. Note that there is no information for customers that start with M (Merchants). 

➢ isFraud - This is the transactions made by the fraudulent agents inside the simulation. In this specific dataset the fraudulent behaviour of the agents aims to profit by taking control of customer accounts and try to empty the funds by transferring to another account and then cashing out of the system. 

**● Power BI Dashboard Creation:** 

➢ Launch Power BI and connect to the preprocessed credit card transaction dataset. 

➢ Design an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard layout with appropriate charts, tables, and filters. 

➢ Create visualisations that provide an overview of transaction statistics, such as total transactions, average transaction amount, and transaction frequency.
